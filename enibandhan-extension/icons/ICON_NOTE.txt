📌 ICON PLACEHOLDER NOTE

The extension currently uses SVG placeholders for icons.

For production, you should replace these with proper PNG icons:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Quick Ways to Create Icons:
1. Use an online generator: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Design in Canva: https://www.canva.com/
3. Use a design tool like Figma or Adobe Illustrator

Suggested Style:
- Colors: Blue (#667eea) and Purple (#764ba2) gradient
- Symbol: Letter "E" or shield with document
- Professional and trustworthy appearance

The manifest.json is already configured to use these icon files,
so just replace the SVG files with PNG files of the same names.
